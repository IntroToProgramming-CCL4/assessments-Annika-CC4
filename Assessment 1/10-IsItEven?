Write a program that tests if a value is even or odd. Follow the instructions outlined below:

Instructions:
The program should ask the user for a number from within the main function.
The entered number should be passed to a function that determines if the value is even or odd.
The function should return a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
The message returned by the function should be printed from within the main function.

def value(a):              #(a) is the assigned container of the number to be inputted

    if a%2 == 0:           # '%' Operator, to check if the number divided by 2 is equal to 0.
        return "even"
    
    else: 
        return "odd"
    
number= value(a= int(input("Please input number: ")))       #The variable 'number' catches the return function.
print(number)                                               #The returned function is now printed to make the code working. 

value()                   #Calling the 'value()' function.
